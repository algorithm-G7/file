File management in operating systems involves organizing, storing, retrieving, naming, sharing, and protecting files. Efficient file management requires effective searching and sorting algorithms to quickly locate and organize files.

Role of Searching Algorithms
Linear Search: A straightforward method where each file is compared sequentially until the desired file is found. It's simple but inefficient for large datasets.

Binary Search: Efficient for sorted datasets. It repeatedly divides the search range in half, reducing the search interval significantly.

Role of Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort: Simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Not efficient for large datasets.

QuickSort: Highly efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot. It's faster and commonly used in practice.

Enhanced C++ Program
We'll expand the C++ program to include:

Dynamic File List: Allow adding and deleting files.

Binary Search: Implement binary search for sorted file lists.

Extended Menu: Provide options to add, delete, search, sort, and display files.
