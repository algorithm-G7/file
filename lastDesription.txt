Explanation of the Code
Main Function:

This is the entry point of the C++ program. Every C++ program must have a main function, which is called at the start of execution.

Vector Initialization:

vector<File> files: This line declares a vector of File objects named files. A vector is a dynamic array that can change in size as elements are added or removed.

The vector is initialized with four File objects. Each File object is created using the File class constructor, which takes two arguments: the file name (as a string) and the file size (as an integer).

Menu Function Call:

menu(files): This line calls the menu function, passing the files vector as an argument. The menu function is expected to provide an interface for users to interact with the files, allowing operations like display, search, sort, add, and delete.

Return Statement:

return 0: This line indicates that the main function is returning an integer value of 0, which generally signifies that the program has executed successfully.

File Class and Functions (Assumptions)
To fully understand the context, we need to assume that the File class and menu function are defined elsewhere in your code. Hereâ€™s a brief overview based on typical usage:

File Class:

Likely includes a constructor to initialize file names and sizes, and a method to display these properties.

menu Function:

This function likely provides a user menu for interacting with the files vector, offering options such as displaying files, searching for files by name, sorting files, adding new files, and deleting files.

Summary
The code initializes a list (vector) of files with specific names and sizes.

It calls a menu function to handle file operations.

The main function returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
