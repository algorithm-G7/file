This code implements the QuickSort algorithm in C++ for sorting a vector of File objects. The sorting can be done based on either the file name or the file size, depending on the sortByName flag.

Breakdown:

partition Function:

Purpose: Rearranges elements in a subarray to partition them around a pivot element.
Parameters:
files: The vector of File objects to be sorted.
low: The starting index of the subarray.
high: The ending index of the subarray.
sortByName: A boolean flag indicating sorting by name (true) or size (false).
Steps:
Select Pivot: The last element (files[high]) is chosen as the pivot.
Initialize: A variable i is set to low - 1 to keep track of the index for the smaller element wall.
Partitioning Loop:
Iterate through the subarray (j from low to high - 1).
Comparison:
If sortByName is true, compare the current element's name (files[j].name) with the pivot's name.
Otherwise, compare the current element's size (files[j].size) with the pivot's size.
Swap:
If the current element is smaller (according to the sorting criteria), swap it with the element at index i + 1 and increment i. This effectively moves smaller elements to the left side of the pivot.
Pivot Placement: Swap the pivot element with the element at index i + 1. This positions the pivot in its final sorted position.
Return: The index i represents the partition point where elements smaller than the pivot are placed to its left, and elements larger are placed to its right.
quickSort Function:

Purpose: Implements the recursive QuickSort algorithm.
Parameters:
Same as partition.
Steps:
Base Case: If low is less than high (meaning there's at least one element to sort), proceed.
Partitioning: Call the partition function to rearrange elements around the chosen pivot.
Recursive Calls:
Sort the left subarray from low to pi - 1 (elements smaller than the pivot).
Sort the right subarray from pi + 1 to high (elements larger than the pivot).
Overall Process:

Call quickSort with the entire vector, low (0), high (vector size - 1), and sortByName.
The quickSort function recursively partitions and sorts subarrays until the base case (low >= high) is reached, resulting in a fully sorted vector.
In essence:

QuickSort uses a divide-and-conquer approach, breaking down the main vector into smaller subarrays.
The partition function rearranges elements in a subarray to separate them into smaller and larger partitions based on the pivot.
The quickSort function recursively sorts the partitioned subarrays until the entire vector is sorted.
The user can choose to sort by file name (sortByName = true) or by file size (sortByName = false).
