This code implements a file management system with various functionalities: displaying files, searching for files, sorting files, adding new files, and deleting files. It uses a vector<File> to store the file information.

Menu-Driven Interface

The menu function provides a user-friendly interface with the following options:

Display Files: Lists all the files in the system.
Search File by Name (Linear Search): Searches for a file by name using a linear search algorithm.
Search File by Name (Binary Search): Searches for a file by name using a binary search algorithm (assuming the files are sorted by name).
Sort Files by Name: Sorts the files alphabetically by name using the QuickSort algorithm.
Sort Files by Size: Sorts the files by size using the QuickSort algorithm.
Add New File: Allows the user to add a new file to the system.
Delete File by Name: Deletes a file from the system based on its name.
Exit: Exits the program.
Functionalities:

Display Files: Iterates through the vector<File> and prints the details of each file.
Linear Search: Iterates through the vector<File> sequentially, comparing each file's name with the target name.
Binary Search: Assumes the files are sorted by name and uses a divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently search for the target file.
QuickSort: A recursive sorting algorithm that partitions the array and recursively sorts the partitions.
Add New File: Creates a new File object and adds it to the end of the vector<File>.
Delete File by Name: Searches for the file using linear search and removes it from the vector<File> using the erase function.
User Interaction:

The menu function repeatedly prompts the user for input, processes the choice, and executes the corresponding function. The program continues until the user chooses to exit.

Key Points:

The File class (not shown in the code) likely contains members like name and size to store file information.
The linearSearch and binarySearch functions return the index of the found file or -1 if not found.
The quickSort function is used for both name-based and size-based sorting.
The add and delete functions modify the vector<File> to add or remove files.
The menu function provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the file management system.
